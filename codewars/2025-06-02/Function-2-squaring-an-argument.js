// JS fundamental problem, difficulty 8 

//Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it.

function squareF (arg) {
    return arg ** 2;
}

//time conplexity is O(1) constant: squaring is a single arithmatic opertation regarless of the size of input.
//space complexity is O(1) constant: the function only uses a fixed amount of memory to store the input and the output


// Another way to do is 

const squareF = (arg) => arg ** 2;
