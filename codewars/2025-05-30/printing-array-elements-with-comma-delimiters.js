"h,o,l,a"

Note: if this seems too simple for you try the next level

//Solution

function commaDelimiter(arr) {
    // merge the array
    return arr.join(",")
}
console.log(commaDelimiter(["h","o","l","a"]))

//Another way, arrow function, dont have to add the comma inbetween the brackets because if nothing is passed in the brackets it defaults to commas

const commaDelimiter = arr => arr.join();
