# Daily Coding Challenges

A collection of coding challenge solutions and practice exercises to improve problem-solving and programming skills.

## Structure

- Each challenge is contained in its own file or folder.
- Challenges cover a variety of topics and data types.
- Solutions are written in JavaScript (or specify your language).

## How to Use

1. Browse the challenges.
2. Review the problem statements (inside each file or a separate description).
3. Run the solution files using Node.js or your preferred environment.

## Example

```js
// Example function from challenge 1
const commaDelimiter = arr => arr.join(',');
console.log(commaDelimiter(["h","o","l","a"])); // Output: "h,o,l,a"
